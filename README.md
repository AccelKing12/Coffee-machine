# Coffee Machine Automation with Arduino

I recently took on a challenging project to resurrect a seemingly lifeless coffee machine that refused to spring to life. After some thorough diagnostics, it became clear that the original circuit board was beyond repair. Undaunted, I decided to take a more hands-on approach and constructed my very own circuit board using an Arduino to breathe new life into the coffee machine.

## Key Components and Functions

My Arduino-based system is responsible for orchestrating three crucial tasks:

1. **Water Intake Control**: I wired the Arduino to a relay switch that regulates the water intake, ensuring the machine gets the right amount of water for the brewing process.

2. **Heater Element Management**: Another relay switch is connected to the heater element. This enables the Arduino to power the heater on and off, maintaining the desired temperature for brewing.

3. **Brewing Process**: The third relay switch controls the flow of hot water to the coffee grounds, initiating and halting the brewing process as needed.

## Additional Features

The Arduino is equipped with a few extra features to enhance user interaction and ensure optimal performance:

- **Thermostat Element**: To maintain precise temperature control, a thermostat element is integrated, constantly monitoring the heat level within the machine.

- **User Interface**: Four tactile buttons facilitate user interaction:
   1. Power On/Off: The primary switch to activate or deactivate the coffee machine.
   2. Start Coffee Brewing: Initiates the coffee brewing process.
   3. Start Coffee Brewing (Yes, again!): For those who can't get enough coffee, this button reinitiates the brewing cycle.
   4. Water Refill: Press this button when you need to replenish the water reservoir, and the machine will start heating it up.

## Challenges and Unresolved Mysteries

In the spirit of full disclosure, I encountered some limitations during this project. Unfortunately, I couldn't decipher the coffee machine's internal sensors to detect when it's running out of coffee. It seems that part of the machine remained a mystery, beyond the reach of my diagnostic tools.

Nonetheless, I'm thrilled with the results of this project, breathing new life into a previously defunct coffee machine. It's now a shining example of how a little creativity, an Arduino, and some relay switches can turn a simple device into a smart and user-friendly coffee-making marvel. Cheers to technology and a great cup of coffee! â˜•ðŸ¤–âœ¨
